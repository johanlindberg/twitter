This is a fork of git://git.busydoingnothing.co.uk/twitter.git

For those of you who have taken the time to actually look at the code. I
should mention that the fact that I'm duplicating code all over the place
is actually a strategy.

I'm using this project to learn more about GNU Emacs and Emacs Lisp but
I don't want to, accidentally, mess up existing features. Once I'm done
implementing new features I will refactor the code in an attempt to remove
unneccessary duplication.

My apologies to @bpeel.
